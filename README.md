# AlgorNX

A python/pygame copy of the Algorea/concours-castor minigames/challenges, for PC and Nintendo Switch (in the future, with PyNX), with a graphical level editor using TKinter.  
The images in `AlgorNX/images/` must be 1-frame/static .gif files, to work with both the level editor and the game itself. They need to be 20x20 pixels. `AlgorNX/images/robot.gif` is unused by the game, but is used as the taskbar icon for the level editor.

## License

This includes the Liberation Mono Bold font (downloaded from [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/liberation-mono.font)), which is licensed under the GPLv2 and owned by Red Hat, Inc (NOT MINE AT ALL), so I licensed it under the GPLv2 as well to avoid any problems, but you can swap out the `AlgorNX/font/font.ttf` file for any font you want to use (I recommend monospace though, and this one looked good).
